# 0.4.2.0 (November 14, 2016)

  - Attempting to generate a fixture for a multi-parameter typeclass now produces a better error message ([#24](https://github.com/cjdev/test-fixture/issues/24)).
  - Fixtures can now be generated for typeclasses containing infix operators as methods. They will be prefixed with a tilde (`~`) instead of an underscore ([#26](https://github.com/cjdev/test-fixture/issues/26)).
